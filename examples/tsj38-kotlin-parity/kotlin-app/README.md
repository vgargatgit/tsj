# TSJ-38 Kotlin Reference App (Baseline)

This Kotlin scaffold mirrors the TS reference structure for TSJ-38 parity tracking.

Current scope:
1. Domain, repository, security policy, service, and web-controller layers.
2. In-memory persistence and simplified policy checks for deterministic parity tests.
3. Baseline shape for migration and behavior comparisons with TS-authored equivalent modules.
