# TSJ-38 Kotlin Parity Reference Bundle (Subset)

This bundle contains parallel TS and Kotlin app scaffolds used by TSJ-38 readiness checks.

Directories:
1. `ts-app`: TS-authored Spring-style module structure.
2. `kotlin-app`: Kotlin baseline with equivalent layering and behavior.

The TSJ-38 readiness gate validates the presence of these scaffolds and combines that
signal with Spring matrix and benchmark artifacts.
