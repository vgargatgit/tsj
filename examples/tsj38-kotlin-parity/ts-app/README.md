# TSJ-38 TypeScript Reference App (Subset)

This scaffold mirrors the Kotlin reference app structure for TSJ-38 readiness tracking.

Current scope:
1. Multi-file domain/repository/service/web structure.
2. TS-authored Spring-style web decorators (`@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, route bindings).
3. In-memory repository and policy classes used as placeholders for DB/security wiring.

This scaffold is used by the TSJ-38 readiness gate and does not yet claim full Spring Boot runtime parity.
